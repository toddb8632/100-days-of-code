## Log

### R1D1 
Work on freeCodeCamp project: Random Quote Generator. HTML is set up, working on jquery, json and using API. Work is on CodePen here: https://codepen.io/toddhcodetime/pen/dZqjby

### R1D2
Continue work of freeCodeCamp project: Random Quote Generator. Still reviewing JSON documentation to understand how to get output from API request to update the HTML and show the quote. Working with two Code Pens for this project:
Got the API updating the message wells with the quote and author, here:
https://codepen.io/toddhcodetime/pen/dZqjby
Also created this pen, to practice using JS for DOM manipulation to append html elements to the page, here:
https://codepen.io/toddhcodetime/pen/aEVaJy?editors=1010
Next I need to figure out how to post/send the message to twitter. Then will work on combining everything and styling.


###R1:D3
Continue work of freeCodeCamp project: Random Quote Generator.
Review documentation to try to understand the API call and JSON.
Tried two approaches:
one using jQuery:
https://codepen.io/toddhcodetime/pen/dZqjby
one using Vanilla JS
https://codepen.io/toddhcodetime/pen/ZvvQLW
Will continue with the Vanilla JS.
